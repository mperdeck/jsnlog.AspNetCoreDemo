# jsnlog.AspNet5Demo
Shows JavaScript logging in a simple ASP.NET 5 application

**Important**

ASP.NET 5 does not automatically restore NuGet packages. To ensure all NuGet packages are loaded, run "dnu restore" from the command line in the directory where you placed this demo site.

```
cd ...directory with AspNet5Demo...
dnu restore

```

You will see some error messages. You can ignore those.
